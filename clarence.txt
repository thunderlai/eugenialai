Three basic tools:
* Text Editor		- for writing, editing code. 
* FTP client		- for transferring files for remote to local and vice versa
* Version control 	- for tracking changes, branching, roll back

Other useful tools:
* WYSIWYG Editor 	- 


Text Editor
===================
Good text editors have features like language support, code completion, syntax highlighting
For web development, generally you want a more lightweight code editor (something that loads and runs fast)

Recommended text editors for Mac OS X:
	Sublime Text 2 
	TextWrangler
	Komodo Edit
	MacVim (requires knowledge of VI)
	Eclipse (more full fledged IDE)

TextEdit is the free, included text editor with Mac OS X. Has no code features but can do the job.
XCode (also free with Mac OS X) is Apple's set of development tools. More powerful than needed for web dev but great set of dev tools.


File transfer
===================
FTP:
File transfer protocol
An FTP client will allow you to transfer files to and from a server that supports FTP (should be most all)
* Connect to a remote server
* log in
* transfer files to/from

Choose an FTP client:
	free:
		native Mac FTP client (Cmd + K from the Finder)
		Filezilla
		CyberDuck
	paid:
		Transmit
		Fetch

SSH:
	Secure Shell
	* allows remote command of another computer
	* can be performed from the command line, using "ssh" command
	* google "ssh" to learn usage

Version Control
===============
Version control is used by developers to track and merge changes, branch, and roll back.

Git allows you to have a local repository and a remote repository. 
You can set up a remote repository on websites such as GitHub or Bitbucket
Even just setting up a local repository and committing changes to it is useful for one man development.


Whenever you make changes to source code, you can "commit" them to your repository. 
This is basically like a "save point". Git tracks the changes you made and allows you to roll back your files to any one particular commit/revision.

If working with multiple developers on the same repository, Git allows you to get their changes, do merges, resolve conflicts.
These features allow many people to be working on the same code base at the same time.

* Choose a GIT client
	free:
		GitHub
		SourceTree

	paid:
