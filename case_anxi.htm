<p>
46 year old Amy had been with our herbal clinic for more than a year for her <b>anxiety </b>  and <b>sleep </b> issues. She lead a stressful job and easily got anxious with dealing with her business associates. Her main complaint was <a href="case_sleep.htm"><b>insomnia</b></a>. Her sleep was generally all over the board.  It took a long time (minimum one hour) to sleep.  Sometimes this was going one every day for a two week period.  Often Amy had 3, 4, or 5 hours of sleep per night. She had hot flashes during day and night. When she got anxious, it would flare up every other hour. Occasional moderate night sweats made her Change clothes but not at night. Her sweat was mainly at upper body. She could go back to sleep but it's generally light sleep. She's often rested in the morning. She also took Ambient when it took too long to fall asleep. Sometimes she had taken Ambient (5mg) almost every day when it was bad. Amy had normal to good appetite.  Her gassy & bloaty issues come and go.
</p><p>
She had weekly acupuncture treatments which reduced her anxiety level.  The herbs also helped her in anxiety pattern, general energy, and GI track; and her muscle achiness lessened.  Since Amy had pretty severe anxiety, we had designed a strong morning anxiety formula and a strong evening calming formula for her.
</p><p>
Amy had faithfully followed the instructions of taking the herbs each morning and night. As she lead a very hectic work life, sometimes it's hard for her to stick to the intake routine. As she rushed out to go to work in the morning, sometimes she would forget to bring the bottle with her and missed her morning intake.  Her main concern was the sleep issues and evening intake had never been a problem for her. When the herbs helped her sleep better, she would get comfortable and more likely to relax in her morning routine of taking her anxiety herbs. When she skipped too many times, her anxiety returned and complained that herbs did not do such superb job as before. We then had to re-visit her formula again and twigged it to suit her new situations.
