Henry came to the clinic complaining of <b>headaches </b>almost every day for the past few years. Every mornig he had to take a cold shower to wake up.  After the shower, he still felt very tired and unable to concentrate.  He described the feeling in his head as if he were wearing a baseball cap at all times.  Henry was concerned about his condition since his father had suffered from a stroke when he was fifty years old.  He also remembered that as a child his father often complained of headaches.  Henry explained that he was living alone, working at a very stressful job (in front of a computer all day) and had a very poor diet (hamburgers, potatoes, donuts and milkshakes).
</p><p>
No particular pressure pain was found upon abdominal palpation.  Pressure pain was detected on his chest, as well as the T3-T4 areas of his back.  Acupuncture needles were placed according to the <a href="http://www.kiikomatsumoto.com/"><b>Kiiko Acupuncture Style</b></a>.  Henry felt much better after the treatment.  </p><p>
He was instructed that he eat as many green vegetables and seaweed as he could and considerably reduce his appetite of meat and dairy products.
</p><p>
One week later, Henry reported that on the morning after the treatment, he woke up more refreshed and with no headache.  On mornings when he did have a headache, it last only about ten minutes.  He also noticed that during the day he could concentrate better.  He was eating much better and was feeling lighter.
</p><p>
After four treatments, Henry felt much lighter, less tired, and did not need a cold shower in the morning to wake up.  He no longer suffered from headaches.  His concentration was good.

Fifty two year old Prya had constant <b>tension headaches</b> that occasionally turned into a <b>migraine</b>.  Her tension headaches were of a muscular type located at the base of her skull.  Prya reported that she had suffered from these headaches for at least eight years.  CT scans and MRI did not show any pathology.  Her physician diagnosed her as having tension headaches with <b>muscular spasoms</b> and prescribed her muscular relaxants and painkillers.  Other than the headaches, Prya had no significant medical history.
</p><p>
Upon palpation of Prya's abdomen, strong pressure pain was found in the lower left corner to her naval.  Mild pressure pain was also found on her lower right region.  Below her neck behind her SCM, it was tight on both side.  Prya's pulse was slow with a "pecking" quality.  Along her spine, Tania was sensitive between C7 and T9 regions.  Her trapezius muscle was very tight and painful upon palpation.  They felt like thick ropes.  In general, all the muscles on Prya's upper back were tight and sore.  
</p><p>
Prya's arms along her <b>Large Intestinal channel</b> were needled to release the tightness in her ab pressure pain.  This is <a href="http://www.kiikomatsumoto.com/"><b>Master Kiiko Matsumoto's</b></a> strategy to treat Oketsu signs.   Then along Prya's stomach channel, needles went in on the "gummy" points at a 10 degree angle in the direction of stomach qi flow.  Some manipulations were executed.     
</p><p>
Then Prya's back side was treated along her spine and her sacral area.  Since her sacral area felt cool to the touch, rounds of <a href="moxa.htm"><b> kyutoshins </b></a> were applied.  Upon removal of all the needles, <a href="moxa.htm"><b>magnets </b><a>were left on
two or three places of acupuncture points.  Prya was instructed to press on the magnets during the days and these magnets could be retained for up to a week unless they were uncomfortable.  In that case, she could remove and throw them away.
</p><p>
Prya followed up with similar treatments on a weekly basis for another six weeks before she could get rid of her migrains and stop all her medications. 
</p><p>
Note: The above two cases came from Master Kiiko Matsumoto's clinic in Newton, Massachusetts.  Please refer to her book, "Kiiko Matsumoto's clinical Strategies".
