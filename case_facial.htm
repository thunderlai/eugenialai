<p>Why Facial Rejuvenation?
</p><p>Facial Rejuvenation Acupuncture has been around for a while.  ABC Television's "Good Morning America" and Public Broadcasting System's "Healthweek" have shown remarkable beneficial results before.  People who prefer naturally smooth facial skin without surgical or chemical interventions usually find acupuncture as a good alternative treatment to BOTOX or facelift.

Benefits of Facial Acupuncture
</p><p>Acupuncture for younger facial skin is a wonderful alternative to fighting the aging blemishes, discoloration, and wrinkles.  Like massaging your facial muscles, acupuncture can increasing the flow of energy, blood, and lymph circulation, improves the face's natural, healthy color with a much deeper and faster presentation.  Unlike massaging, acupuncture can accomplish the result of diminishing wrinkles and eliminating fine lines in shorter time, without any effort from the person, and with lasting benefit.  Acupuncture increases muscle tone and elasticity and reduces bags and sagging while nourishing the skin.
</p><p>
How does facial rejuvenation work?
</p><p>
A licensed, board certified acupuncturist would recommend 6-8 initial treatments taken twice a week. Subsequent visits will be once a week for 6 weeks. Each treatment takes an hour. Further treatment for maintenance care may be advised once a month to enhance the results for many years. Positive changes are usually noticeable during the first 6-8 treatments. Treatment plans may be personalized for each patient and/or combined with Chinese herbs depending on environmental and health factors that impact the skin.  
A course of treatment consists of 10-15 sessions (generally 12). We recommend that clients have the first 6 sessions twice a week and have the last 6 sessions once a week to get maximum result. This means that a full course of sessions takes 9 weeks to complete. 
</p><p>
Some results may be seen as early as the 2nd or the 3rd session but the effects become most noticeable and lasting on or about the 7th or 8th session. In some exceptionally difficult cases, the course of treatment may need to be repeated again. As in surgical facelifts, the actual outcome and how long the effects will last cannot be predicted. Each person responds differently, depending on his or her age, condition and lifestyle prior to treatment. For this reason, results for some may be more or less dramatic than they are for others.
Following the initial course of treatment, monthly maintenance sessions can prolong the results for 5 to 10 years. The benefits of a monthly maintenance program are not limited to the face, but rather, improve the body's overall health and vitality. This, in itself, slows down the aging process.
</p><p>An experienced acupuncturist also teaches  patients facial exercises, and dietary and lifestyle awareness in order to encourage them to take
responsibility for their own health and well-being.  Most acupuncturists believe that working together achieves the most successful optimum results!

<p>
Michelle was a 43 year old female who had <b>work stress</b> issues for more than three years.  She has been treated with acupuncture by another acupuncturist for the problem on the regular basis.  She found our website and came to our clinic for <b>facial rejuvenation </b> acupuncture treatments. She drove 45 minutes to come to our clinic because she could not easily find another acupuncturist who's specializing facial in the Greater Boston area.
</p><p> During the first four twice-weekly treatments, Michelle went through a routine body treatment first.  Before a herbal paste mixed with egg white were applied on her face, a small patch was tested on her arm to see if her skin was allegic to the solution. Once no allergen was detected, the paste was spread over her skin.  Twenty minutes later, the paste was removed and Michelle's face was wiped clean.  Twenty tiny and thin needles were applied on her face.  Needles stay on for another twenty minutes.</p>
You can see Michelle's facial skin getting smoother, rosier, and gracefully radient as each week comes by. The same process was repeated twice weekly for four weeks.  After that Michelle continued on a weekly basis.  </p><p>
Michelle's skin now looks delicate and pinkish.  Her face has a naturally healthy glow and blemish-less like a new-born baby's skin.  
</p><p>
She likes her skin so much, she continues her facial treatments on a regular basis at least once a month.
