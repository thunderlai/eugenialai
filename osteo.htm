<b>"Osteoporosi"</b> is one of the most important health topics for elderly and post-menopausal women.  The coming on of osteoporosis is silent, gradual, and uneasy to detect.  For elderly who unknowingly inflict osteo may easily cause bone fractures by simple bumps and falls. Post menopausal women loose bone marrow at a faster rate as their estrogen decreases with the ceasation of menstruation.  As estrogen decreases, the loss of bone marrow increases which contributes the loss of bone density as aging progresses.  As population ages, clinical osteoporosis and bone fractures increase significantly.  As western medicine research and diagnoses have had great developments, the treatments still lack effective treatments without side-effects.  The result of current treatments can only reduce the loss of bone marrow.  There is no significant progress in increasing bone quantity and reducing occurrence rate of bone fractures.

<p>Osteoporosis is a diagnosis in modern medicine.  In TCM theory, kidney qi deficiency is the main cause of osteoporosis.  The usual clinical symptoms include lower back pains, sores, weak lower limbs and joints, etc. the main symptoms of osteoporosis. For osteoporosis patients tend to have bone fractures.  TCM doctors treat osteoporosis abide by the principle of regulating and tonifying three organs of spleen, liver, and kidney.  
</p><p>
TCM viewpoints organize osteoporosis into three types: 
</p><p><ol><li><b>
Kidney Yang Deficiency</b><br><br>
Main symptoms include sore, cold, painful waist or/and knee. Low energy, clear and long urination, thin or/and weak pulse, thin white tongue coat, etc.  This type accompanies degenerating arthritic patients.  The herbal formula used often include: shu di, du zhong, mu dan pi, shan yu rou, lu jiao jiao, shan yao, etc.  Warm and tonify kidney yang can increase quality of sexual hormone, increase the immunity function, strengthen building bones, and extend the effect and treatment of osteoporosis.  The general formula used include: both Zuo Gui Wan and You Gui Wan.
</li><br><br><li><b>Spleen Qi Deficiency</b><br><br>
Main symptoms include sore, cold, painful waist or/and spine. Weak limbs, poor appetite, lusterless yellow face, pale tongue with white tongue coat, and slow and weak pulse.  This type tends to have biased eating habits.  Spleen losing its strengths may cut off the original source of qi and blood transformation and leading to osteoporosis.  This type uses Spleen strengthening herbs like dang shen, fu ling, bai zhu, shan yao, etc.  The use of these herbs not only help treatments of osteoporosis, but also remedy the over tonification of kidney essence.  A common formula include: Shen Ling Bai Zhu San, and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang for long term use.   
</li><br><br><li><b>Liver and Kidney Deficiency</b><br><br>
Main symptoms include sore, weak, painful waist, knee, or/and rib-chondria region. Palm/Sole heat, dizziness, whirling feelings, insomnia, dried throat and tongue, red tongue without much tongue coat, and thin fast pulse.  This type mostly belongs to females after menopause.  These herbs generally are used to nourish liver and kidney: shu di, gou qi zi, shan yu rou, ze xie, etc.  TCM doctors regard the liver organ as a ¡§zang¡¨ (organ) which stores blood and is in charge of smooth and transform function.  The main effects not only influencing Spleen¡¦s transform and transport function and its movement and unblock of qi and blood¡¦s circulation, but also regulates menstruation, pregnancy, and lactation.  Therefore in treating osteoporosis, it is often necessary to add herbs of nourishing liver and kidney.  Common formula include Si Wu Tang and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan for long term use.

Nowadays improper diet habits and over indulgence in diet or fasting, may possibly cause absorption of insufficient calcium or loss of calcium.  Insufficient absorption of calcium may reduce bone density leading to osteoporosis. To prevent osteoporosis needs to begin with daily eating habits.  Osteoporosis patients need to pay extra attention to their nutrient intake.  
</p><p>
[Here we skipped the recipes full of Chinese herbs cooked with meat and vegetables together...]
</p><p>
Prevention is more important than treatment.  To prevent osteoporosis begins at younger ages.  In daily lives, it's important to maintain a healthy exercise routine which can improve growth of bone marrow and minimize loss of bone materials.  It's necessary to have sufficient sun shines on skin, maintain suitable rest and good moods.  Stay away from smoking and binging on alcohols; On dieting, maintain balanced diet with nutrients, avoid too much meats and process foods, choose low salt diets, minimize caffeine, and more milk; during growing period, pregnant and lactation terms, especially take care of absorption of sufficient calcium.  Elderly should prevent bone fracture, stay away from taking unprescribed medicine, get periodic exam for bone density, taking suitable supplements of vitamin D, to minimize osteoporosis.
