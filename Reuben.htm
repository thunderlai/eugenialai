<p>In my workshops, and more frequently in my own clinic, lots of people are insatiable in obtaining more nutritional information. For very basic nutritional knowledge, I often recommend reading Dr. David Reuben "Everything You always wanted to know about nutrition" (1979). The paperback version is of 236 pages long. The book's premise is simple. We have been educated by the advertising media skewed by the food industry to promote products and profit. The information was so wrong, as Dr. Reuben tells us, that much of our diseases and troubles involving the body (cancer, diabetes, etc) can be prevented if we simply take the precautions he tells us in this book. His ideal diet, or what you can do to be healthy can be summed up in one sentence: eat food in their natural form of fruits, vegetables, and any other foods. </p>
<p>The book is very good. I totally agree with Dr. Reuben's assertion that the main causes for Americans to become unhealthy is simply consuming the additives and the preservatives added onto the food and drink we ingest. Dr. Reuben goes on to say that the chemicals found in our food cause cancer and even sperm count. He also says in the book that the reason non-industrialized countries like Georgia have much less of cancer and diabetes is because their food is natural. </p>
<p>Dr. Reuben's recommended diet should consider: Foods in their natural form: </p>
<ol><li>Don't buy food where the ingredients cannot be pronounced. </li>
<li>Don't buy refined sugar, or enriched bread. </li>
<li>Don't drink soda. </li></ol>
<p>Dr. David Reuben also wrote another book: "The Save-Your-Life Diet".  You can probably find it in a used book store. </p>
<p>Here are some excerpts from the book "Everything You always wanted to know about nutrition":</p>
<p><b>Why do you say that selling vitamins is nonessential? </b> (page 2)</p>
<p>"Just think about it a minute.  For over 50,000 years the human race has flourished - long before there was ever such a thing as a vitamin pill and long before the word vitamin ever existed.  Even today, man's nearest relatives - monkeys, apes, and the rest of the simians - thrive without gulping pills of any kind - and they are healthier than most Americans!</p>
<p><b>Isn't it a good idea to take vitamin B12 just in case?</b> (page 32)</p>
<p>"It's not a matter of "just in case". Of course it's a good idea to take vitamin B12.  But that's not a problem.  The problem is how can anyone avoid taking vitamin B12?  The chemical is in virtually every food of animal origin, and even though it is water-soluble, it takes a long time for symptoms of deficiency to appear after you stop all intake of B12.  The FDA Recommended Daily Allowance is a whopping 6 micrograms a day, which is an excellent example of the way the FDA encourages overconsumption of expensive and unnecessary vitamins.  Everybody thinks - or used to think - "if the government recommends it, then it must be good." Let's see.  Six micrograms a day of B12 adds up to 186 micrograms a months of an expensive vitamin.  If you had a life-threatening deficiency of the chemical and were not absorbing any at all from your diet, your doctor would only give you 100 micrograms a month.  But your government encourages you to take almost twice as much as the victims of pernicious anemia - who really need it.</p>
<p><b>What about people who don't eat any B12 at all?  Don't they need to take B12 pills? </b>(Page 33)</p>
<p>"That's what they'd like you to believe.  Some prominent nutritionists, who should know better, tell us that it is absolutely essential to eat meat to avoid a "dangerous" deficiency of B12.  (By coincidence some of these same "experts" are paid consultants to the powerful meat producers' associations.)  The dumbest thing they say is that vegetarians are living on borrowed time because they can't get any B12 from a vegetarian diet.  That news will come as a surprise to 500,000,000 Hindus, most of whom don't eat any meat or animal products at all from the moment they are born until the moment they die (with the exception of mother's milk for a while).  The Hindu religion has been around for over 10,000 years, or about 98 centuries longer than "modern American medicine". Deficiencies of B12 are virtually unknown among these vegetarians, and they miss out on a few other little things too, like cancer of the colon, heart attacks, diabetes, and other "signs of progress".</p>
<p><b>Don't vitamins have any medical qualities? </b>(Page 36)</p>
<p>"Of course they do.  Vitamins are chemical substances, and like all chemicals in large enough amounts they can have significant effects on the human body.  Think of it this way - the amount of a vitamin required to prevent the symptoms of a vitamin deficiency can be measured in thousandths or even millionths of a gram.  Those are the amounts you easily obtain in the several pounds of food you eat every day - provided you eat decent unprocessed food...</p>
<p>"But trying to cure "tiredness", "lack of pep", sexual impotence, and a thousand other self-diagnosed conditions by popping commercial vitamins is sheer madness.  Instead of throwing away hundreds of millions of dollars every year on vitamins in the form of pills that they can get for nothing in the form of breakfast, lunch, and supper, Americans should save their money.  When they have enough, they can just invite a friend over to dinner.  Believe me, it's a better investment.</p>
<p><b>What about orange juice? </b>(Page 43)</p>
<p>"Kindly remove your hat when you speak about orange juice for this is the sacred liquid to 220 million Americans.  By a miracle of advertising, the orange growers of the United States have convinced us that eating oranges and drinking orange juice are sensible ways of getting vitamin C and curing colds.  They are wrong for telling us that, and we are wrong for believing it!  Penny for penny and milligram for milligram, oranges and orange juice are an awful source of vitamin C.</p>
<p>"If you want larger amounts of vitamin C at lower cost than orange juice, try any of the following: broccoli, Brussels sprouts, collards, turnip greens, mustard greens, and red cabbage.  Hot peppers have 400 percent more vitamin C than the orangiest orange.  Tomatoes, spinach, asparagus, liver, and ham are excellent sources of C.  Even the lowly baked potato (skin included) contains a nice shot of C.  But no one thinks of these foods as packed with vitamin C. Probably because so far no sexy chick has gone on TV to do thirty-second commercials for, say, Brussels sprouts. </p>
<p><b>Isn't it important to take plenty of iron? </b>(page 57)</p>
<p>"No, it isn't.  As a matter of fact, taking iron when you don't need it can lead to certain problems, including impotence and frigidity, heart failure, diabetes, and liver cancer.  But those nice young ladies who peddle iron tonics on television never tell you that.</p>
<p>"Iron is a mineral, and unlike vitamins, you never use up your supply of iron.  The average person has about 4 grams (or one seventh of an ounce) of the metal in his body; about two thirds of it is deposited in the red blood cells.  Although red blood cells are scrapped about every four months, the iron is carefully recycled and used to make more red cells, so theoretically there is no need to take any iron into the body at all.  Actually, however, there is a tiny daily loss of iron in feces, sweat, urine, and bile.</p>
<p><b>But don't women lose a lot of iron during their menstrual periods?</b> (page 57)</p>
<p>"That's what the iron-tonic-and-snake-oil peddlers on TV would like you to believe.  They say: "Because you are a woman, you have a very special need for iron? ..." Kind of scary, isn't it? What they should really tell you is this: "The average iron loss without menstruation is about half a milligram per day.  During menstruation, the total loss of iron increase to an insignificant 1 milligram daily. The average woman in the US and Europe consumes about 16 mg of iron daily, or sixteen times the maximum average loss during the menses."</p>
<p>But the trouble with the truth is it doesn't sell iron pills.</p>
<p><b>I've heard that it's important to get enough salt.  Is that true?</b> (Page 71)</p>
<p>"It certainly is.  But the real challenge in most "modern" countries is to keep yourself from being pickled by the salt in your daily diet.  Salt is composed of two vital chemical elements: sodium and chlorine.  Its chemical name is sodium chloride.  It is present in every body fluid, including blood, sperm, spinal fluid, digestive juices, and is found within every cell.  But the amount of salt you need to stay healthy is very very small.  For the average man it amounts to 200 milligrams a day, or about one twentieth of a teaspoonful.  The average American who gorges on processed food consumes about 20 grams, or almost a full ounce of salt a day! That's about 100 times what his body needs and adds up to big trouble.</p>
<p><b>Is it true that the American diet contains too much fat? </b>(Page 89)</p>
<p>"That depends on what you mean by "too much". The diet of the average American contains more fat than anything else.  As of now, we consume over 40% of our calories each day in plain and fancy fat.  Other nations are happier and healthier on much lower fat consumption.  Japanese, for example, get only about 10% of their daily calories from grease and oil.  (Not by coincidence the rate of heart attacks in Japan is also one tenth the US rate.)  The typical American sloshes about 100 pounds of fat into his digestive system each year.</p>
<p><b>But how can anyone eat that much fat? </b>(Page 89)</p>
<p>"It's easy if you don't think about it.  Fat is part of the American culture.  Flip through the average ladies' magazines or the food section of your newspaper; most of the ads and the recipes are for foods that are basically fat.  These are the high-prestige, high-stratus foods of our society.  Every festive occasion in American life floats on fat. </p>
<p><b>What are carbohydrates?</b>  (Page 119)</p>
<p>"Try it this way: let's check out knowledge of carbohydrates with the following test.  Which of the following statements about carbohydrates are true?</p>
<ol><li>Something bad that will make you fat.</li>
<li>An essential part of your diet.</li>
<li>Undesirable foods that rot your children's teeth.</li>
<li>The fastest route to a heart attack.</li>
<li>Good wholesome food.</li>
<li>A way to get gypped out of your food dollars.</li></ol>
<p>If you marked all six correct, you know a lot more about carbohydrates than the food processors of America think you know.  Just as with protein and fat, the gigantic food companies and their play-for-pay experts have done a big number on carbohydrates.</p>
<p><b>Why do we hear so much about how important it is to eat a lot of protein? </b>(Page 145)</p>
<p>Because there's a lot of profit in protein.  Protein has become a status food, a political football, a pseudoscientific fad, and a high-profit supermarket seller all at the same time.  The truth is: there is no magic in protein.  You need relatively small amounts in your diet, and it's easy to get it if you know where to look for it.  You can find cheap sources of protein that taste better, provide better nutrition, and will help you live longer than a fatty slab of beefsteak.  But to do that you have to know what protein really is.</p>
<p><b>How does sugar stack up as a food? </b>(page 167)</p>
<p>"It's impossible to say because sugar - that is, white refined sugar - is not a food.  It is a pure chemical extracted from plant sources, purer in fact than cocaine, which it resembles in many ways.  Its true name is sucrose and its chemical formula is C12H22O11.  It has 12 carbon atoms, 22 hydrogen atoms, 11 oxygen atoms and absolutely nothing else to offer.  Refined sugar has no vitamins, no useful minerals, no enzymes, no trace elements, no fiber, no proteins, no fat, and no benefit whatsoever in the human diet.  Aside from that, it's fine.</p>
<p><b>What is an ideal diet? </b>(page 193)</p>
<p>"Let's get one thing straight right from the beginning: the ideal diet of the human race is the one that God has provided for them, period. That's it. Anyone who tells you anything else is trying to sell you his product - or somebody else's product.  Since the first man set foot on earth, human beings have instinctively known how to select their diet correctly.  The great mass of food advertising is designed to compel you to distort your diet by eating expensive substitutes for natural wholesome food.  A black African in his tiny village eats a more wholesome diet than the millionaire in his penthouse on Park Avenue.  A monk in Tibet eats better than a movie star in Hollywood.  A farmer's wife in Spain eats better than a society woman in Miami Beach.</p>
