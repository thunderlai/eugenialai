<p><b>Peter: </b>
"Hi, Eugenia -</p><p>
"Well I met my goal of bicycling 100 mi in one day.  Thanks for you help, my back and legs felt good after last treatment, breathing was much better and I was able to train consistently up to century ride event.
</p><p>
"I'm not sure how to ask this question but here it goes. I have been experiencing some male sexual issues.  Can you treat this with acupuncture or herbal medicine?
</p><p><b>
Eugenia: </b>
"Both acupuncture and herbs can help.  We can discuss this in details if you want.
</p><p><b>
Peter: </b>
"I feel kind of funny taking about this issue but you are easy to talk to. You seemed to know everything about the human body and offer solution that works.
</p><p>
"Basically I sometimes only get partially erect, since the last two weeks or so. I've read that sometimes this happens from biking but I don't know for sure.
</p><p><b>
Peter: </b>
"What kind of herbs can help?
</p><p><b>
Eugenia: </b>
"Chinese herbal treatment that I do is to treat your overall body issues.  The body is functional when everything is in balance.  When there is an issue that originates from the body imbalance either in the channels of energy or in the organs.  In any case, it's all connected and related.  And the formula I prescribe is based on what your symptoms present themselves.  It doesn't go by the western diagnosis of, for example, impotence.  Because everyone's origination is different so the prescription is different, too.  I pick about ten to twenty herbs from a total of 400 to come up with the formula.  So, I cannot tell you exactly which herbs I choose until I talk and ask you about a few issues before I can come up with the formul.
</p><p>
"However, there are patent medicine made specifically for sexual issues.  Some of the patent medine (like pills) act like viagra and are available in the herbal pharmacies.  Some may include western medicine like synthetic compounds.  If you want, I can tell you where to get them.  We can talk about this when we meet next week.
</p><p>
After the acupuncture and herbal treatment, <b>Peter: </b></p><p>
"Either the acupuncture or herbs worked.  Unfortunately my wife has been out of commission with monthly cycle then backache and yeast infection due to some antibiotics she was taking.
</p><p>
"So in theory your therapy is working but unfortunately I haven't been active to feel results.  Hopefully soon.
</p><p>
"When you placed the needles for CV-2, CV3 points, I remembered later that I bought a book a while ago -  Acupressure for lovers.  It provides some interesting information for bringing intimacy even closure in your life.  There was a section on different technics for sexual issues that I need to review.  Unfortunately my wife has never been really interested in practicing some of the exercises from that  book. I guess I can just casually introduce some of the pressure points for both of us or at least me.
</p><p>
"Eastern medicine is so intriguing to me.  It has been practiced for thousands of years and I always wonder how they figured out pressure points, use of acupuncture and herbs to heal humans. So amazing to me!
</p><p>
"Thanks for you help and I'll be in contact soon.
</p><p>
"Kind Regards,
</p><p>
Peter
