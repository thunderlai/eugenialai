In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the objective of weight control focuses on maintaining a well balanced body function.  Practitioners diagnose clients based on their individual symptoms using  
TCM differentiation methods.  Various weight loss treatments include acupuncture, moxibustion, cupping, diet, lifestyle, and Chinese herbal prescriptions.  To achieve the goal of long-term weight issues, incorporating all these methods is best. 
</p><p>
For some clients who have financial concerns, a combination of some of these alternates is possible. However, it is important to adhere some basic simple rules described in the following.  
</p><p>
We ask our clients to train themselves in some of our concepts of:

Please understand that:</b></p><p><ol><li>
The speed of weight loss varies from person to person according to each person's physical characteristics, variety of exercise programs, etc.  As you fit programs to your schedule, the trend and the progression of path vary.
</li><li>The Chinese herbs we use in our clinic follow GMP standards set by Food and Drug authority.
</li><li>Herbal intake: 3 times daily 30 minutes before meals. (If you can only do 2 times, make it up by adding 1.5 times each dosage.)
</li><li>Normal response: the following responses are normal.  Once body functions gradually adjust to the new routine, everything will return to normal.
</li></ol></p>

<div id="Sec2b" style="position: relative; width:400px; height: 200px;	float: left; left: 60px; top: 0px; border: 0px solid rgb(64, 128, 128)" class="Helve2">
<p><br />
Above steps are taken under certain cautions: </p><p>
1)	Special natural fibers have been added to encourage clients to drink more water.  Some people may find themselves thirsty in the beginning of the program.  Drinking more water will reduce the thirst.
</p><p>
2)	On average 5 in 100 (especially females) may find themselves exhibit slight palpitation or dizzy.  This is because the increase speed in circulation and metabolism.  It generally takes 2 or 3 days to return to normal.  For those people who routinely skip breakfast or have low blood pressure tend to have this type of symptoms.   Small pieces of chocolates, sweet drinks, or exercises can loosen up the symptom.
</p><p>
3)	For the minor few who have digestive issues, increased frequency in bowl movements may be expected.

<p><b>
Special Notes:
</b></p><p>
1)	First meal and second meal are normal meals.
</p><p>
2)	Evening meal is required to prohibit starch (bread, noodles, rice, etc.) and fried foods (anything involving oil in cooking or serving).  Boiled or steamed vegetables, chicken, fish, egg, non-sweet fruits (like tomato, apple, guava, kiwi, etc) and light soup (not too many spices added) are all right.
</p><p>
3)	Drinks exclude icy, sweet, or milk products.  Icy or sweet fruits should be minimized.  For example, watermelon, pear, pineapple, orange, mellon, mango, and banana, etc.
</p><p>
4)	Include breads only in the first meal of the day.  Minimize the oil content.  For example, white/wheat/multi-grained bread without anything on.
</p><p>
5)	The total quantity of liquid intake should be limited in 2,000 cc.  Urination needs to be 7+ times a day to avoid edema (which increases weight).
</p><p>
6)	Weight loss needs to be gradual.  The target is 2 pound a week.  This is a healthy loss of weight.
</p><p>
7)	Change the sequence of meal intake: first vegetable, then meat/chicken/fish, then vegetable again.  Small bites in slow motion.  Minimum 20 chews in one mouthful.
</p><p>
6)	Exclude any food which produces high calories or is one of condensed foods.  Especially those sweet, rich, fried, oil-based foods include candies, canollies, cakes, and animal skins etc.
</p><p>
9)	If you feel hungry between meals, you can try those volumnous, low in calorie, and satisfying food like vegetables and fresh fruits. 
</p><p>
10)	Please avoid using female hormones which increases weight.  This includes birth control pills and ovulation drugs.
</p><p>
11)	Be sure to soak in hot bath every day.  The temperature of the water needs to be more than 72F.  Soak your body up to your waist for 15 to 20 minutes to avoid being dizzy (Please read <a href="MaYueLing.htm"> Hot-Soak </a>). Skip this step if you have a heart condition or high blood pressure.   
</p><p>
12)	Between two meals/two intakes of herbs it needs to be at least two hours apart.
</p><p>
13)	Take note:  weight loss is NOT immediate.  It is necessary to work with your practitioner.  Don't drastically reduce your weight and japadize your health.  Be sure to call if you have any questions.  Don¡¦t make judgements or decisions on your own stop the weight loss program.  It will reach the goal of weight loss and maintain your health.
</p><p>
14)	Be sure to advise your practitioner about any conditions like dizziness, headaches, menstrual irregularities, edema, allergies, etc.  Weight loss and maintenance can be achieved at the same time!
</p><p>
Be patient about weight reduction.  If you persist on abiding these rules for a few weeks, you will definitely see results.  Best wishes and good luck!
