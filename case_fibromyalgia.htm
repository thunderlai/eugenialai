<p>
Forty two years female, Lan, came to our clinic for <b> chronic fatigue </b> issues.  She had a very low energy of a 4-5 out of the scale of 1- 10; whereas a 1 in the scale indicates a situation that one stays in bed and can not get out of bed and a ten indicates superb energy that one can run, swim, and do anything one wants.    Lan felt that she was stuck with psychological issues which had been going on for 15 yrs.  She was on Zoloft and Bupropion, both are anti-depression drugs.

She had stabbing pains on her right eye brow, <b>head aches</b> on her sides only.  She did not have dry throat but dry eyes only.  If she stood  up too quickly, her head felt moderate <b>foggy</b>.  It's an effort for her to work around it.  She had foggyness problem all her life.  There was no ear blockage.  She could not tolerate noisiness.
