<p>A 60-something year old college professor, Hank, had been coming to our clinic since a few years ago.  His main complain was: (1) <b>IBS</b>; (2) <b>Allegies</b>; (3) <b>Heartburn</b>; and (4)  Mild <b>Prostatis </b>issues.
</p><p>
His head usually had mild nasal congestion without ear blockage.  Sometimes following symptoms showed up: mild cloudy, foggy head; mild post nasal drip; usually no dizziness. He had a few palpitations, 2-3 times during 3 week's period.  His appetite was generally good with or without heart burns. In the past, Hank's alternated diarrhea and constipation off and on.

<div style="width:650px; height: 600px; float:left;position: relative; left:30px; border: 0px solid black;" class="Helve2">
<p>His stomach got gassy, bloating, or spasms below navel easily. When school was out, his conditions improved. He went to bowel movement daily or more frequently depending on stress, weather, or events. It could be well-formed (or not, when he got into flare-ups.) and 80% of the time complete.  He had mild muscle-skeletal issues like his left foot got swollen with tingling feelings which were unpredictable and could come & go.  The lab X-rays showed negative results.  His energy was an 8 out of a scale of 10.  Hank relied on sleep med (Clonzapam, 1/8mg) and sleeps usually 6 - 6.5 hrs. Sleep had been an issue for Hank.  
Although he usually stays asleep, he did not feel that he was sleeping soundly and only felt rested two days out of a week. He felt mildly anxious most of the time.
</p><p>
Hank's tongue was swollen toward pale and slight purple with thick greasy coat.
</p><p>
Lots of stress and tension caused Hank's Qi and blood stagnation. He was diagnosed with three burners issues. His liver Qi and liver blood were blocked.  Among the three burners, his problem tends to be more on the lower burner. Bloaty caused blockage. Treatment principle recommends: moving herbs to clear spasm; Soothing herbs to clear bloating. 
</p><p>
Under Dr. Tao Xie's tutorledge, we prescribed a formula in concentrated powder for Hank which includes Chao Bai Shao, Zhi Gan Cao, and Sheng Bai Zhu to strengthen his digestive system, and other herbs to clear heat and smooth Hank's digestion. 
</p><p>
Hank has this digestive issue for a long time.  He tried western medicine without success.  He found meditation helpful in stablizing his conditions but until he found Chinese Herbs he found his daily routines difficult to manage.  Now he comes to our clinic every two weeks.  Although he still had issues off and on, he really felt his conditions more manageble.  He continued to meditate morning and night. Out clinic adjusts his formula every time according to his situations.  He could not stay on the same formula because his condition was unstable.
