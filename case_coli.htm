<p>Chuck was a 26 year old student whose doctor diagnosed him to be a <b>ulceratic colitis</b> case 5 years ago. He was diagnosed with <b> Chrone disease </b> 7 years ago. He found Chinese herbs provide him with much more energy. With some of the herbal formula, sometimes he got slight constipated.  When that happend, he would be instructed to stop taking herbs for a day or two until no cramping.  Then he started a smaller dosage before getting back to his normal dose. Chuck had been diagnosed with osteoarthritis six months ago.  He had also been treated  with acupuncture, too.  It relieved most of his muscle & tendon pains.

<p>Chuck got headaches a few times, but they were not on a regular basis. Sometimes he got a weird dull headaches; but his head was not foggy, nor cloudy. He did not have sinus issues.  Chuck generally had good appetite without nausea, bloating when he was on herbs.  He still got gassy a little, mild and 1 to 2 times a week.  He did not have acid regurgitation. Chuck used to have 15 to 20 times bowel movements daily; <b>bleeding, cramping</b> due to cold bothering him via air conditioning. After he went on herbs, his movements were not hard to pass.  They were complete and no blood. With herbs, his bowels were more and more toward well formed.  His sleep was OK. Falling asleep was ok with normal toss & turns.  His body temperature was cold.  His energy level was about a 7 out of a scale of 10. Chuck wanted to do more but getting up to go to gym had been tough for him.  That was not normal for him.  He had been under a 6 month depression.  He felt sluggish, no mobility, anxious, and restless. Chuck tends to have depression.</p><p>
Chuck's tongue was usually red, slightly purple, and not rested.  His diagnosis was a kidney Qi/Yang deficiency.  The treatment principle was to tonify SP, tonify energy, tonify Qi & blood flow. </p><p>
His typical formula in powder includes Mi Huang Qi, Dang Shen, Chao Bai Shao, and other herbs to strengthen deficiency, kidney and yang.</p><p>
Chuck had been coming for his herbal prescription twice a month for six months. His case was under the tuturledge of Dr. Tao Xie from Quincy, Massachusetts.
