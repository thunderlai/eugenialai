<b>Women's Issues and Treatment </b>
</div><p>
In recent years acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine have been increasingly used as an alternative and complementary treatment to various women issues.  Here are a brief introductory description of these topics in the context of Chinese medicine:<b> <a href="#infer">infertility</a>, <a href="#pms">PMS</a>, <a href="#ear">early periods</a>, <a href="#late">late periods</a>, <a href="#irr">irregular periods</a>, <a href="#dys">dysmenorrhea</a>, <a href=#amen">amenorrhea</a></b>, and <b><a href="#meno">menopause</a></b>.

<center><a name="Infer"></a><h4>Infertility</h4></center>
</div><p>
<b>Description:</b>  Infertility is defined as the inability to concieve  in a woman who has been trying to get pregnant for 2 years. A broader view of infertility includes not being able  to carry a pregnancy to term and have a baby.  Infertility affects about 6.1 million Americans,  or 10 percent of the reproductive aged population,  according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. It is a myth that infertility is always a "woman's problem."  About one third of infertility cases are due to problems with the man  (male factors) and one third are due to problems with the woman  (female factors). Other cases are due to a combination of male  and female factors or to unknown causes. 4 types of female problems: <ol> <li> Infrequent ovulation or failure to ovulate, e.g.   polycystic ovary syndrome. <li> Fallopian tube blockage. <li> Uterus dysfunction e.g. endometriosis, fibroids. <li> Cervical problems. </ol> 
</p><p>
<b>In Chinese Medicine:</b>  According to Chinese medicine the most common cause is Kidney  deficiency (mostly kidney yang and essence deficiency) due to: Constitutional weakness, or overwork for a long time can damage the  kidney essence. Kidney is the root of the yin and yang of the body  and it is the main support of the reproductive system. However Liver is also involved in most cases. Liver stores the  blood of the uterus, it is responsible for the flow of qi in the  body which affects the blood circulation. 
</p><p> 
<b>Case:</b>   A 38 year old woman, came to the herbal practice after IVF  failed 3 times. She recieved herbal preparations  for 6 months to prepare the ovaries and the uterus for the pregnancy.  Only after preparing the reproductive system,  did she try IVF and became pregnant. She now has twins.

<center><a name="pms"></a><h4>Premenstrual Syndrom (PMS)</h4></center>
</div>
<p><b>Description:</b>  Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a group of symptoms related  to the menstrual cycle. PMS symptoms occur in the week or  two weeks before menstruation. The symptoms usually go away  after your period starts. PMS may interfere with activities  at home, school, or work.  The causes of PMS are not yet clear. Some women may be more  sensitive than others to the changing hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. Stress may make it worse. PMS can affect  menstruating women of any age. PMS often includes both physical and emotional symptoms.  
<ol><li> breast swelling and tenderness  
</li><li> fatigue and trouble sleeping  
</li><li> upset stomach, bloating, constipation or diarrhea  
</li><li> headache  <li> appetite changes or food cravings  
</li><li> joint or muscle pain  
</li><li> tension, irritability, mood swings, or crying spells  
</li><li> anxiety or depression  
</li><li> trouble concentrating or remembering. 
</ol></p><p> 
PMS affects more than 90 percent of fertile women at some  time in their lives. 
</p><p>
<b>In Chinese Medicine:</b>  According to Chinese Medicine PMS relates to disorders in  the Liver, Heart, Kidney and Spleen. The most important  organ is the Liver, emotional strain affects the liver and  the flow of qi in the body is disturbed.  
</p><p> 
<b>Case:</b>   A 45 year old woman with severe PMS symptoms lasting two  weeks out of a 4 weeks cycle came to my practice. She had  severe cramping, bloating, breast tenserness and extreme  irritability. I treat her with an herbal formula 2 weeks  out of the month, and with acupuncture every other week.  Her symptoms are 90 percent reduced.

<center><a name="ear"></a><h4>Irregular Periods- Early Periods</h4></center>
</div><p>
<b>Description:</b>  Early periods refer to menstrual cycles that occur 7 to  14 days before the normal 28 day cycle. The amount of  bleeding can be normal, excessive, or scanty.  
</p><p>
<b>In Chinese Medicine:</b>  There are  two main reasons for early periods according to Chinese  medicine:  
<ol> <li> Qi deficiency of the Spleen or Kidney. The menses  can't be controlled. (In this case the blood is pale).  We treat this condition by tonifying the qi. This may be  caused by constitutional weakness, excessive work, illness  or emotional stress. 
</li><li> Heat in the blood is another factor. Heat accelerates  the flow of blood causing early periods. Heat in the blood  can be due to yin deficiency, or Liver fire. In this case,  the blood is dark and red. We treat the pathology according  to the pattern. If it is a yin deficiency, we tonify the yin.  If it is due to liver fire, we clear the liver heat and  sooth the liver. 
</li></ol>

<center><a name="late"></a><h4>Irregular Periods- Late Periods</h4></center>
</div><p>
<b>Description:</b>  Late periods refer to menstrual cycles that occur 7 days  to 5 months later than the normal 28 day cycle. They can be  accompanied by changes in the quantity and quality of the blood  during menstruation.  
</p><p>
<b>In Chinese Medicine:</b>  There are two main causes for late periods: <ol> <li> Blood deficiency: There is insufficient blood to fill   up the uterus and flow on time. This condition may   occur before Menopause. Organs involved: Kidney essence   and Liver blood. We tonify the blood and the essence. <li> Liver qi stagnation or other pathogen blockages like   cold or dampness impair the flow. We try to eliminate   the pathogen. If there is cold, we warm the uterus.   If there is Liver qi stagnation, we sooth the liver. </ol> 
</p>

<center><a name="irr"></a><h4>Irregular Periods - Unpredictable Menstrual Cycle</h4></center>
</div><p>
<b>Description:</b>  The time of cycle is not fixed. Sometimes it is early and  sometimes it is late. This situation is normal in the first  year after menarche (the onset of menstruation), and during  menopause.  
</p><p>
<b>In Chinese Medicine:</b>  Three organs may be involved in the pathology: The Kidney  (kidney qi or essence deficiency), Liver(qi stagnation), and  Spleen (qi deficiency). The Kidney stores the essence and  is the root of both yin and yang in the body. Due to a  constitutional deficiency, over-exertion or excessive sexual  activity, the kidney fails to stabilize the uterus and the  distribution of blood. The Liver controls the flow of qi in  the body. Due to emotional causes (anger and/or frustration), the qi does not flow smoothly, and the period is not fixed. The Spleen keeps the blood within the vessels and when it is  weak, it fails to stabilize the period. We treat this  condition by finding out the relevant pathology: if there is  a deficiency we tonify and if there is stagnation, we move  the qi.

<center><a name="dys"></a><h4>Dysmenorrhea</h4></center>
</div><p>
<b>Description:</b>  Dysmenorrhea is painful menstrual cramps. Primary dysmenorrhea is not associated with any other disease. Secondary dysmenorrhea is accompanied by another disease, for  example, uterine fibroids, endometriosis, inflammation or tumor. Symptoms usually begin one to two days before menses and peak  on the first day of flow. It then subsides during that day or  over several days. However, the pain can occur during and after  the period. The pain is typically described as dull, aching,  cramping and often radiates to the lower back. In severe cases, pain may cause nausea, vomiting, headache  and fainting. The cause of the pain, according to Chinese  medicine, is caused by the stagnation of qi and blood. 
</p><p><b>In Chinese Medicine:</b>  The cause of this stagnation can be cold, heat, dampness or  pathogens blocking the free flow of qi and blood. However, a deficiency of qi blood or essence can also cause  the stagnation. In this case, there is not enough energy or  force to move the qi and blood properly. In most cases, cold  in the uterus is one the main reasons for dysmenorrhea.  Cramps are a sign of contraction caused by cold. We warm the  channels to releive the pain, regulate the qi and invigorate the  blood.  
</p><p> 
<b>Case:</b>   A 42 year old woman came to my clinic with severe cramping  lasting 2 weeks before her period. She had pain radiating  to the lower back. This Pain was accompanied by irritability  and constipation. I treated her with acupuncture moxibustion  and cupping, and gave her an herbal formula to use 2 weeks every month. The symptoms are completely controlled now.  
</p>

<center><a name="amen"></a><h4>Amenorrhea</h4></center>
</div><p>
<b>Description:</b>  Primary amenorrhea is the absence of the menstrual period  by the age of 16. Secondary amenorrhea is a condition in  which menstruation begins at the appropriate age, but later  stops for 6 or more months. It is commonly due to hormonal  disorders, a psychological disorder or a chronic disease  such as diabetes, nephritis or anaemia.  
</p><p>
<b>In Chinese Medicine:</b>  Causes in Chinese  medicine include deficiency of qi and blood, Liver and Kidney deficiency and/or yin deficiency. Stagnation and obstruction  by pathogens such as cold heat or phlegm can also cause the absence of periods. Once we identify the pattern we  treat it: deficiency-tonify, excess-eliminate the pathogen. 
</p><p> 
<b>Case:</b>   A 32 year old woman came to the Herbal Clinic in 2003 after  having only one period at age 17. After 3 months, she got  her first period, which was scanty and lasted 2 days. Her next period arrived after 60 days. Menstruation then  came every 33-45 days. After 3 years of herbal treatment,  she now has regular periods. 
</p>

<center><a name="meno"></a><h4>Menopause</h4></center>
</div><p>
<b>Description:</b>  Menopause is the permanent cessation of menstrual cycle.  It is a normal condition. Major symptoms associated with  menopause: <ol> <li> Hot flashes and night sweats occur in about 75 percent or menopausal women. They vary in severity and  frequency. Most women have them between 2 and 5 years. <li> Vaginal dryness and reduction of sex drive. Dryness in the vagina results in painful intercourse  which reduces sexual desire. <li> Emotional symptoms such as irritability,  nervousness and anxiety.  </ol> 
</p><p><b>In Chinese Medicine:</b>  In Chinese medicine the  menopausal symptoms are the result of Kidney deficiency  i.e. Kidney Yin deficiency or Kidney Yang deficiency and  Kidney Essence deficiency. Since the Kidney is the root  of Yin and Yang in the body, their deficiency will  influence other organs. Tonifying the Kidney is a major  treatment strategy. 
</p> <p>
<b>Case:</b>   A 52 year old woman came to my office for back pain  and night sweats. I treated the back pain with acupuncture  and her night sweats with herbs. After the first week,  her night sweats were reduced by 20 percent. The second  herbal formula reduced her night sweats by 80 percent.  She used herbs for 3 months, then took a break. The  night sweats came back a year later, but were much  milder. I gave her one more herbal formula to treat her menopausal symptoms. She has very mild night sweats now.
