<p><br /><br /><b>Why Facial Rejuvenation?</b><br /><br />
</p><p>Facial Rejuvenation Acupuncture (or some people call it Acupuncture facelift) is becoming a more popular, non-surgical method for those who want not only to maintain beauty, radiance and vitality in the face, but also to improve their overall health and well being.  Acupuncture facelifts have even been featured in the mainstream media, such as on ABC Television's ¡§Good Morning America¡¨ and Public Broadcasting System's ¡§Healthweek.¡¨ Studies show that among 300 cases treated with facial acupuncture, 90 % had marked beneficial results with only one course of treatment (International Journal of Clinical Acupuncture, 1996).

<p><b>Benefits of Facial Acupuncture</b></p><p>
Acupuncture for facial beauty is a wonderful, holistic, alternative approach to fighting the aging process.   
</p>
<p><ol><li>Increasing the flow of energy, blood, and lymph circulation - improves the face's natural, healthy color, diminishes wrinkles and eliminates fine lines.
</li><li>Promoting collagen production increases muscle tone and elasticity it helps to firm the skin, fill out wrinkles, and reduce bags and sagging.
</li><li>Stimulating the formation of body fluids - nourishes the skin and encourages it to be moister, softer, smoother, and more lustrous. Chinese herbs like Greatly Tonify Yin Pills (Da Bu Yin Pian ) work excellently in replenishing Yin energy (body fluid), which is extremely beneficial in the prevention and/or improvement of wrinkles resulting from menopause or cigarette smoking.
</li><li>Healing physical, emotional and spiritual issues to reduce stress and improve overall health and well being - Since the body/mind/spirit are all connected, negative emotions reflect in the face and change the appearance of skin texture, color, and tension.  Acupuncture can eliminate stress and bring out the innate strength, vitality and health. In addition to enhancing skin appearance, most people are pleased to find that their sinus problems, headaches, toothache, TMJ, PMS and menopause have either disappeared or their symptoms are distinctly improved! You will not only look younger but also most certainly feel younger.
</li><li>Excellent alternative approach without surgery and injection - Acupuncture is far less expensive, more natural, non-invasive and safer than plastic surgery or botox injection(s), and has no side effects, toxicity, inflammation, or recovery time.

<b>How does facial rejuvenation work?</b>
</p><p>A licensed, board certified acupuncturist would recommend 6-8 initial treatments taken twice a week. Subsequent visits will be once a week for 6 weeks. Each treatment takes an hour. Further treatment for maintenance care may be advised once a month to enhance the results for many years. Positive changes are usually noticeable during the first 6-8 treatments. Treatment plans may be personalized for each patient and/or combined with Chinese herbs depending on environmental and health factors that impact the skin.  
A course of treatment consists of 10-15 sessions (generally 12). We recommend that clients have the first 6 sessions twice a week and have the last 6 sessions once a week to get maximum result. This means that a full course of sessions takes 9 weeks to complete. 
</p><p>
Some results may be seen as early as the 2nd or the 3rd session but the effects become most noticeable and lasting on or about the 7th or 8th session. In some exceptionally difficult cases, the course of treatment may need to be repeated again. As in surgical facelifts, the actual outcome and how long the effects will last cannot be predicted. Each person responds differently, depending on his or her age, condition and lifestyle prior to treatment. For this reason, results for some may be more or less dramatic than they are for others.
Following the initial course of treatment, monthly maintenance sessions can prolong the results for 5 to 10 years. The benefits of a monthly maintenance program are not limited to the face, but rather, improve the body¡¦s overall health and vitality. This, in itself, slows down the aging process.
An experienced acupuncturist also teaches  patients facial exercises, and dietary and lifestyle awareness in order to encourage them to take
responsibility for their own health and well-being.  Most acupuncturists believe that working together achieves the most successful optimum results!      
</p><p><b>How acupuncture treatments are performed?</b></p>
<p>In general, a facial mask containing blood-invigorating herbs will apply to the face for 15 to 20 minutes.  After removing the mask, about 40 tiny needles apply to the face at various pressure points on the face.  Because the needles are tiny, once patients feel a small prick at insertion, they stay on the skin level without pain.  Patients' face would get slight feeling of vibration for twenty minutes.  Once needles are removed, the vibration can stay on a little longer.  Patients feel relaxed and rejuvenated afterwards.
</p><p>    
Facial acupuncture is the Hollywood star's shortcut to younger looking skin. 
</p><p>Who wouldn't want to look 10 years younger in just 20 minutes? In America, you can - as long as you don't mind lying in a darkened room with needles protruding from your face, eyes and ears.
The rich, the vain and the famous (reportedly Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cher) are having weekly "acupuncture facelifts" to ward off their wrinkles.
The "facelift" is administered by a doctor of Oriental Medicine (or OMD), who spikes your face with disposable, hair-thin needles that - allegedly - turn back time and halt the physical manifestations of ageing. 
The needles are inserted into wrinkles and frown lines, eventually making them vanish. 
The stimulation brings blood rushing to the face, which makes it look flushed. Apparently, after a few sessions, eyes brighten, skin feels firmer, lips become plumper and blemishes vanish.
