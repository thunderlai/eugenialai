65 year old Paul had <b>arthritis </b>.  What brought him to our clinic was his hip pain. It started two years ago. It gradually got worse. His pain was about a 8 on a pain scale of 10. He had been limping because of his pain along his inner thigh. After sitting a while in a chair, he had trouble getting up.  He could not put on his socks by himself.  He used to play golf every weekend.  Now his pain prevented him from playing. He had heart issues so he was on Digoxin and Attenolol.</p><p>
He had good appetite but sometimes he felt gas.  He had to get up at night to go to bathroom 2 to 3 times per night.  His pulse was slippery.  His tongue was slightly dark with greasy tongue coat.  </p><p>
Acupuncture treatments include both the frontal and back treatments while moxa rolled into threads burning near the needles.  After the first treatment, Paul felt immediately relief.  The pain reduced to a scale of 4.  After 5 weekly acupuncture treatments, he pain level reduced to a 2.  He no longer limped.  </p>

67 year old Dan had <b>sciatica </b>pain which prevented from walking too far away from his chair.  The pain was a 10 in the pain scale of 10.  He tried chiropractics for six month before showing up at acupuncture clinic.  He had osteoarthritis and was on blood pressure pills daily.  
</p><p>
After first acupuncture treatment, Dan did not get an immediate relief.  He was still in pain and could not go out.  At subsequent weekly treatments, cupping, and Ci-Luo methods were added onto acupuncture treatment.  Until the fourth treatment, Dan declared that his pain was much reduced and he could drive his car then.

60 year old Mike complained about his right hip pain (buttuck) which started 4 weeks ago. He walked with his cane.  His doctor diagnosed <b>osteoarthritis </b>a year ago.  Moving in and out of his car had been difficult for Mike. He was unsure exactly how his pain came about, but he had slipped on an icy ground 2 months earlier. He takes cholesterol med Simvastatin, Stenolol (blood), Citalopram (depression), and Alprazolam (anxiety) daily.  He tried physical therapy which made his pain worse and chiropractic therapy without significant improvement.   
</p><p>
After his first day acupuncture, he found significant improvement.  However, his pain came back at night three days later.  Within a week, he was back to clinic for his second acupuncture treatment.  He felt the same relief the second time.  Since his physician scheduled to operate that week, he did not continue his acupuncture treatments.
