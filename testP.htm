"I am a 60 year old professional who spends 80% of his workday sitting in front of a computer. Several weeks ago I experienced an aching feeling in my right buttock and hip area. I saw my doctor a week later which coincided with my annual physical exam. The results of my physical were excellent but by then the pain in the hip became extreme. I was given an anti-inflammatory medication, a cane and sent for x-rays. I returned a week later and my doctor said it appeared to be osteoarthritis of the hip and felt that I needed hip replacement.
</p><p>
I was referred to an osteopathic surgeon who determined after showing me the x-rays that hip surgery was not necessary and the real problem was a case of sciatica. He gave me a prescription for physical therapy, twice a week for four weeks, and to return for another evaluation. Now it was at this point in time that I truly felt I needed acupuncture because it helped me to quit smoking four years earlier and, as a result of its benefits, I continued monthly to help relieve me of work related stress and high blood pressure. The person I was seeing had moved their practice out of the area last year but I had learned so much about acupuncture it helped me to find Eugenia Lai. I reviewed Eugenia's website, along with others, and found Eugenia's the most credible and informative based upon my prior experience and research.
</p><p>
To get back to my problem, I made two visits to an established physical therapist with prescribed exercises to do at home. The result was that I called the surgeon the day after my second PT visit because my pain was now at an extremely unbearable level. I would visit Eugenia and leave with a significant reduction in pain only to have it reversed by the PT. I've discontinued the PT and had an MRI this past Thursday night with an appointment to meet with the surgeon on Monday afternoon. Meanwhile, I met with Eugenia on Friday for our third treatment and am very happy to say that the pain has been reduced considerably to the point where I get to sleep sooner than before and get a normal 8 hour sleep. For two weeks prior, with the PT, I was lucky if I could get to sleep within 3 to 4 hours (having to sit-up) and only got 2 to 3 hours of sleep overall each night for 2 weeks.
</p><p>
Although I am not totally pain free as yet and regardless of the what the surgeon does, probably an injection, I am extremely confident that Eugenia will be able to help me. Eugenia is truly a wonderful lady, an extremely knowledgeable professional in her field with a very warm and pleasant personality.
Its not very often that you meet such a professional like Eugenia but I definitely recommend her services to anybody who is experiencing any degree of pain, discomfort or ailment listed in her website to take the time to meet with Eugenia." <br />--- Paul O.
