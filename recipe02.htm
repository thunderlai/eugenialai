Among friends we circulate health articles that can help us improve ways of taking care our bodies better.  Enclosed is one related to an alternative ways to deal with gallbladder stones. It is the method of "Olive Oil Natural Way to Rid of Gallbladder Stone".  One friend recently helped her father rid of his gallbladder stone.  The procedure is safe, simple, fast, and cost saving.  The method can speedily rid of gallbladder stones and the pain associated with it.  This is her story to share with others.  The recipe follows later.

<p>physician recommended surgery immediately to remove stones.  Because he had heart surgeries before.  Any procedures involving supersonic sound wave shakes require physician¡¦s evaluation before operation can be performed.  Especially supersonic sound wave shakes are dangerous to people who had heart surgeries previously.  
</p><p>
After a few days of dad's taking drugs, self-evaluation, and considering dad's 80 years old body to undergo such taxing procedures, we decided to use olive oil natural rid of stones.  The stones are smoothly expelled.  
</p><p>
I need to thank Buddhist Education Foundation and Master Rou Chiuxia who taught us this method so my dad followed the method and naturally rid of gallbladder stones.  He serves as reality check and proves it is not necessary to operate under surgical procedures to heal yourself. 
</p><b>Necessary Materials</b><p>
1. Extra Virgin olive oil is about 0.47liter.
</p><p>
2. 10 - 12 fresh lemons.
</p><p><b>Notes:</b></p><p>
1. On the day of  stone removal stay away from any food after lunch.  Drinking water or juice is all right.  Nothing is allowed after 6pm including water.  If you prefer drinking juice, it¡¦s better to drink apple juice which can soften stone.
</p><p>
2. Preparation work is to squeeze all lemons into juice jar and store it for later use.
</p><p><b>
Procedures:</b></p><p>
1. At 7pm in the evening begin cleansing by adding 4 table spoons of olive oil in a bowl.  Add 2 table spoons of lemon juice into the bowl.  Mix well and drink it.  If it feels too oily, add 3 more table spoons of lemon juice.  For people with constipation issues, more olive oil and lemon juice can be added.
</p><p>
2. Drink the above mixture of olive oil and lemon juice every 15 minutes.  Drink it total 10 times, until it is all finished.  It takes one hour. If ten times do not finish it, drink until it is too much to do so. 
</p><p>
3. After drinking ends, pat the whole body gently and go to bed.  The next morningor during the night, stones may be expelled smoothly without pains.  Stones may be green, red, black, etc.  They may be variety of colors, floating in the toilet, and can be fished out with a seeve while flushing the toilet.  You will find a lot of stones.  
</p><p>
It is best to get family members to help feeding drinks.  The process of drinking is difficult, because it is boring.  Family members help feed drinks makes it a lot more comfortable.
</p><p><b>
By the Way:</b></p><p>
For the first time examining the expelled stones, I could not find any hard stones.  All I could see are mixed colored soft pieces.  Later I found out that dad had been drinking incredible amount of apple juice four days straight.  Because apple juice has softening power on the stones.  They all became soft.  People may ask whether it is necessary to drink huge amount of apple juice.  The answer isup to your own preference.
</p><p>
<b>Lemon juice: </b>is to soften gallbladder tube. <b>Olive oil: </b>is to excrete huge amount of bile to rid of stones.  To choose olive oil to rid of stones is because its treatment duration  is short, method simple, the apple juice method ¡¥s treatment duration is long, materials needed are more.  Besides olive oil method is quick to see results.  Body recovery is fast.
