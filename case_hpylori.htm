45 year old Santos came to our clinic for his <b>acid reflux </b>problem.  He has good appetite.  Within one hour after he eats, acid would come to his throat/mouth and his chest would feel pressure pain.  He was diagnosed with <b>H. Pylori</b> and his doctor put him on antibiotics.  He was taking Protonix without too much help.  His tongue showed pink, tendency to red, and moderate toward purple.  He has thin white tongue coat.
</p><p>
We prescribed some Chinese herbal formula in extract powders including jiang ban xia, jiang zhu ru, and dai ze shi to help his digestion and other herbs to relieve dampness and clear heat.
</p><p> After the first week of taking the herbs, Santos reported that his acid reflux was 40% less.  The same formula was used again for the second week.  Santos felt much better then, a further 50% less of acid reflux.  His bloating after eating was also significantly better.  The third week's formula followed the similar pattern and Santos continued to improve.

A 60-something year old college professor, Hank, had been coming to our clinic since a few years ago.  His main complain was: (1) <b>IBS</b>; (2) <b>Allegies</b>; (3) <b>Heartburn</b>; and (4)  Mild <b>Prostatis </b>issues.</p><p>
His head usually had mild nasal congestion withou ear blockage.  Sometimes following symptoms showed up: mild cloudy, foggy head; mild post nasal drip; usually no dizziness. He had a few palpitations, 2-3 times during 3 week's period.  His appetite was generally good with or without heart burns.  In the past, Hank's alternated diarrhea and constipation off and on.  His stomach got gassy, bloating, or spasms below navel easily. When school was out, his conditions improved. He went to bowel movement daily or more frequently depending on stress, weather, or events. It could be well-formed (or not, when he got into flare-ups.) and 80% of the time complete.  He had mild muscle-skeletal issues like his left foot got swollen with tingling feelings which were unpredictable and could come & go.  The lab X-rays showed negative results.  His energy was an 8 out of a scale of 10.  Hank relied on sleep med (Clonzapam, 1/8mg) and sleeps usually 6 - 6.5 hrs. Sleep had been an issue for Hank.  Although he usually stays asleep, he did not feel that he was sleeping soundly and only felt rested two days out of a week. He felt mildly anxious most of the time.
</p><p>
Hank's tongue was swollen toward pale and slight purple with thick greasy coat.
</p><p>
Lots of stress and tension caused Hank's Qi and blood stagnation. He was diagnosed with three burners issues. His liver Qi and liver blood were blocked.  Among the three burners, his problem tends to be more on the lower burner. Bloaty caused blockage. Treatment principle recommends: moving herbs to clear spasm; Soothing herbs to clear bloating. 
</p><p>
Under Dr. Tao Xie's tutorledge, we prescribed a formula including Chao Bai Shao, Sheng Bai Zhu, and Huang Qin to help clear heat, digestion, and other herbs to strengthen Hank's intestines.
</p><p>
Hank has this digestive issue for a long time.  He tried western medicine without success.  He found meditation helpful in stablizing his conditions but until he found Chinese Herbs he found his daily routines difficult to manage.  Now he comes to our clinic every two weeks.  Although he still had issues off and on, he really felt his conditions more manageble.  He continued to meditate morning and night. Out clinic adjusts his formula every time according to his situations.  He could not stay on the same formula because his condition was unstable.
