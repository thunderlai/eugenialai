<p><br /><br />The popular Chinese TCM advocate Ma Yue Ling (see bottom of the page note) wrote about way of soaking your feet every day to improve your health and longevity. I translated the article as follows: 
</p><p>
Soaking your feet every night in hot water rewards the day-in-day-out-hard-working organs with the most practical loving care you can provide.  At the same time, soaking your feet may make you sleep deeper and feel more rested afterwards.
</p><p>
It also increases our body・s immune function.  In this modern age, easy access to various bathing choices minimizes our inclination of feet-soak
</p></div>

<p> as the singularly exclusive wash at the end of a day.  Soaking in a hot bath or taking a hot steam can extend vessel walls, leading blood flows to limbs, and draining blood from essential organs and brains.  Therefore, overly tired or weakened people after a long day・s work may find themselves dizzy, palpitation, or weak without strength after soaking in a hot bath or taking a hot steam.  [Compared to this, feet-soak is a lesser of the same issue.]
</p><p>
Soaking your feet needs high buckets.  Through heat the meridian channels in the feet and fore-legs can relax, improving blood circulation, and increasing blood supply in the area of the heart and the brains.  As ever-increasing flows of heat come running through, body may expire and sweat mildly.  Channels are being soothed and moved via the movements, getting rid of cold qi and wastes, adjusting body temperature, and reducing deficient heat.  Besides, as blood circulation improves, it can produce an obvious benefits to adjust blood pressure (either high or low ones).  I recommend to friends that after a hard-working day they spend at least half an hour to relax and let body re-adjust.  Don・t look down on this period of 30 minutes.  If you do this every day, only this one item of soaking feet can extend your life to ten more years.
</p><p>
<b>1.	Method of soaking</b>
</p><p>
Use wooden bucket.  It・s best for keeping warmth.  However, wooden buckets are heavy and expensive.  It・s not convenient.  Plastic bucket can be used as alternate.  While soaking in the warm water, keep adding hot water.  Electrical foot buckets are available in the market now.  If you can find one with its depth covering your fore-legs, that would be ideal.
</p><p>
<b>2.	Timing</b>
</p><p>
Most people choose the time right before bed as their soaking time.  It is convenient, for one thing.  It also helps sleep.  If you have time, especially for elderly, it・s best to choose 5pm to 7pm.  That's the kidney time [click and read about  <b><a href="clock.htm"> Chinese Clock </a></b> ] during which time slot their energy is most abundant.  Soaking feet at that time will definitely tonify kidneys at the most effective way.  In general, the goal was to make the whole body warm with mild sweat.  Once you achieve that, the job is done.  After soaking, be sure to drink lots of water.  Replenish water in time.  It・s best to drink warm water or fresh ginger red sugar water to make body produce more heat.  Through sweating, body can expel cold damp out.  For kids, most cases apply in the winter or when catching colds.  If colds, it is necessary to soak until sweat. 
</p><p>
<b>3.	Water Temperature</b>
</p><p>
The endurance of heat varies from person to person.  In the beginning, it is better to start with not so hot water.  Then add hot water slowly.  Keep the hot water coming to the bucket until the whole body warm with sweat.
</p><p>
<b>4.	Why some people don't sweat during soaking?</b>
</p><p>
Long term feet soakers don't have this issue.  Only those people who just start soaking recently have the issue.  This is due to the heavy deposit of cold dampness deep inside the body.  Persistent soaking feet will rid of body・s cold dampness.  Once cold dampness is expelled, it will be easy to sweat. 
</p><p>
<b>5.	Why some people feel unwell after soaking?</b>
</p><p>
Some people exhibit tight chest or dizzy when soaking time is long.  This is due to water heat is too high which expands blood vessel walls in feet too much.  Much more blood flow to limbs resulting depletion of blood supply in organs heart, kidneys, and brains.  It happens to patients with deficient qi and blood.  For them, not only soaking feet causes them to feel uncomfortable,  but also taking bath would cause even more discomfort.  Because the blood supply is low, more blood go to feet, blood supply of main organs shows shortage then.  For these patients, I will tell them, the time of soaking feet should be less.  It is important to eat right kinds of food, choosing foods that can nourish blood and kidneys.  This is to fundamentally change the shortage of blood.  Patients heeding my advices, in addition to augment nutrition, they also add suitable foot-soaks in their daily routines.  Persisting this for 15 to 30 days, they would not appear to have tight chests or dizziness any more.  Adding more time and higher soaking temperature, they manage to warm body enough to mild sweat then.</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>6.	What should diabetes patients deal with hot soaks?</b>
</p><p>
Some reports say that hot soaks increase diabetes patients・ blood sugar right afterwards.  I have met diabetes patients who exhibit this phenomenon.  I will tell them to rub the sole of their feet, 100 times on each foot.  After the massage, blood sugar won・t be high due to the soak.
</p><p>
<b>7.	Is it necessary to add anything to the soaking water?</b>
</p><p>
It is best not to add stuff into the soak arbitrarily.  The effect of the heat may increase body・s ability to absorb the medicinal added into the soak.  If body contains heavy coldness, you can add Ai-Ye (a warming and moving herb) into the soak.  Once or twice a week is enough.  Not every day.  When adding Ai-Ye, one small batch is enough.  Please remember not to add salt into the soak water.  It hurts kidneys, causing edema.  Among my patients who soak, some read newspaper reports recommending adding salt which causes their whole body edema making kidney and endocrine issues worse.  Patients with athlete feet may add vinegar in their soak.  This can kill germs and stop itchiness.  If you can persist using warm water in your foot soaks long term, that・s good enough for health.  Please don・t think of adding various medicinal into the soak.  If the medicinal is not suitable for your condition, it may actually make your body sick.
</p><p>
<b>8.	Can other health methods be used in the soak simultaneously?</b>
</p><p>
Adding round rocks at the bottom of the soak is quite all right if you want to step on them while soaking to achieve the effect of massage.  This can be used for younger generations.  Patients and elderly should refrain from doing it.  Both are deficient in qi and blood.  Massaging through heat, more action causes blood to flow down.  Massaging both ears, head, and both arms may lead qi and blood upward, improving blocked blood vessels of heart and brains.  This will improve blood circulation.  People with neck issues should soak their hands in the hot water while soaking their feet.  This can improve situations related to neck, cervical spines, as hot soaks done persistently.  As heat waves hit the whole body while soaking, move your neck, shoulders, waist, and back rigorously, you will feel relaxed, comfortable.  At this point to hit the pillows in bed, your sleep will be deeply satisfying and gain much better quality.  Keeping this routine up for a long period of time, body will strengthen or regain its immunity.  Its natural defense mechanism will recover or get stronger.  In my clinical observation, people who maintain the feet soaking routine for a long period of time don・t have obvious heart, brain, or blood vessel issues, nor cancer concerns.  Therefore, let us get this habit stick.  Insist on feet-soak every day.  Let the blood circulation flow speedier.  Get rid of coldness and coolness out of our bodies.  Move meridian channels! Unblock them! Make them flourish!  Add on food nourishments to replenish qi and blood.  Let us make no excuses to get sick! 
</p><p>
<b>9.	Is feet-soak suitable for children?</b>
</p><p>
The goal of feet-soak is to improve blood circulation and replenish Yang Qi.  Children are bodies of Pure Yang.  There is no reason for them to have feet-soak.  Washing by itself is enough.  However, some kids have weaker constitutions.  For those who have cold hands and cold feet, adults may give them feet-soaks in the winter.  When they catch colds, feet-soaks in hot water ridding coldness is necessary.
</p><p>
<b>10.	Would feet-soak help improve dark circles around eyes? </b>
<p><p>
Using soak to heal dark circles around eyes due to deficient sleep may only be suitable for people with liver fire situations and younger people.  For females, weakened patients, or elderly who are suffering insomnia, only TCM diet regiment combined with soaks may help sleep.
</p><p>
<b>11.	Why am I sweating on my body but not on my head after soaking?</b>
</p><p>
Sweating at upper body indicates deficient qi.  Sweating at lower body indicates kidney coldness.
