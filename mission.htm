<br />We bring Complementary Alternative Medical (CAM) care solutions to your health problems. Acuremedy is built on the principles of Oriental medicine (OM) applying a natural and gentle way to stimulate our ability to cope with a variety of physical, emotional, and psychological issues.  In empowering our inner strength, we incorporate the OM methodologies and acupuncture techniques practiced by famous masters like Richard Tan and Kiiko Matsumoto in treating chronic conditions and restoring our body balance and health. 
<p>
OM has proven to be effective in Asia for more than three thousand years. </p><p>
Acuremedy brings this tradition to Danvers with personalized treatment and affordable services. In order to provide the most effective natural care,  Acuremedy makes every effort in implementing its procedures and programs based on its four founding principles:
</p><ul><li>
Focusing on our complementary alternative medical care of the root cause rather than simply symptoms, we encourage you to activate your innate healing energy to overcome chronic conditions and achieve sustainable health and wellness;
<br /><br /></li><li>
With our eyes on comprehensive care, we advocate benefits of improving your lifestyle by persistent holistic eating habits, exercises, and experiencing a remarkable increase in energy and vitality, while maintaining natural ways of healing through acupuncture and Chinese herbs. 
<br /><br /></li><li>
With our location near major medical facilities (like Lahey Clinic & Beverly Hospital) and our holistic solutions that are complementary to Western medicine, you will benefit from the best of both worlds.

Acuremedy  provides a safe, soothing and comfortable treatment atmosphere. We offer free consultations for your personalized treatment plan. Our services include Acupuncture and Herbal medicine. We also teach our patients new skills to take care of themselves in lectures, senior center classes and community adult education series. Since inception, we have effectively treated various chronic conditions. We strive to better integrate our therapies into conventional healthcare and further enhance their medical and cost effectiveness. In addition to treatment of general chronic conditions, Acuremedy offers four specialty services:
<br /><br /><a href="#Head">Back to Top</a><br /><ul><li>
Fertility & Women's Health - We are developing an optimal combination of acupuncture, herbal medicine, and stress relaxation to restore women's natural balance and reproductive functions. Our treatment helps many women to succeed in either natural or IUI/IVF-assisted pregnancies.
<br /><br /></li><li>
Chronic Pains & Injuries - We are also developing a proper combination of acupuncture and herbal remedies to activate ones inner capabilities to heal the primary injuries beneath chronic pains. The aim is to restore one's physiological balance and to prevent pains and injuries from becoming chronic.
<br /><br /></li><li>
Holistic Rehabilitation - We help patients with disabilities resulting from strokes, chronic pains & injuries, degenerative conditions or anxiety to naturally re-establish  their physical, mental and emotional equilibrium.
<br /><br /></li><li>
Holistic Weight Loss - We help clients to develop their own holistic and sustainable program in balancing daily diet and controlling cravings & binges, while improving body metabolism, strengthening nutrient absorption, and regaining their mental stability and tranquility.
<br /><br /></li><li>
Educationl Workshop - We teach many people how to think in Asian culture ways to prevent chronic debilitating conditions and to strengthen sustainable wellness. Our  workshop is usually held in community senior centers and adult education in North Shore areas.
</li></ul>
Acuremedy  nurtures and attracts highly trained acupuncturist. Our first acupuncturist, Eugenia Lai, while providing superb acupuncture treatment services, continues to re-educate herself by apprenticing under the tutor ledge of two well known Masters:  Kiiko Matsumoto Sensei, Newton Acupuncture Clinic,  and B. J. Wang of E-Shan-Tang at Allston, Massachusetts on a weekly basis. 
<br /><br />
In OM, acupuncture provides stimulation of vital energy reverberating through the meridians in the body.  When the energy flow is side tracked or blocked, it causes soreness, numbness, or stabbing pain.  Human body resembles towns and cities.  Energy flows can be imagined like traffic with cars running through traffic lights.  When too many cars are stuck in one place, it causes congestion.  A stimulation of acupuncture needles work like turning red lights to green.  A strategic turning of lights in important junctions can divert crucial traffic to proper channels, not only alleviating pains but also restoring health.  To all of us at Acuremedy with our loyal clients, we strive for SUSTAINABLE WELLFARE instead of indulging in quick fixes for temporary relief.
