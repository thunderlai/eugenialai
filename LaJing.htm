<p><br /><br />La-Jing is a Chinese exercise of stretching shrunken tendons.  Shrunken tendons can cause various illness such as <b>neck pain, waist or back pain, leg pain or spasms, difficult bending or kneeling, short & long feet, swollen or numb or sore hand/foot/elbow/knee, or other hard to do physical activities</b>. Master Cheng-Xiang Zhu from the famed Hong Kong TCM Practioner Family developed a simple method of La-Jing method through his clinical experience of fifty years.  This method is low cost so many a person can easily afford its application.  It is easy to practice, quick to see result, suitable for any one (young or old, male or female) to practice.  You can practice at home or office, as to prevent getting sick, healing, or benefit at getting healthy.

<p>There are two styles of Master Zhu's La-Jing:  lying down and standing up.
</p><p><b>
La-Jing I: La-Jing at Lying-down <br /> <br />
La-Jing II: La-Jing at Standing-up
</b></p>

<p><b>
La-Jing I: La-Jing at Lying-down <br /> <br />
</b></p><p>
1.	Put two steady and flat chairs near wall or door-side.
</p><p>
2.	Sit by wall or door-side at edge of chairs.  Move butt as close to the wall or door-side as possible.
</p><p>
3.	Ly down face up.  Raise right foot straight up against wall pole or door support. Left foot bend at knee touching floor.  Raise both arms flat on chairs.  Make it ten minutes.  During this time left foot can do cycling exercises which benefit loosening hip joints.
</p><p>
4.	Move chairs to the opposite side and repeat the previous exercise switching right to left and left to right.  It also takes ten minutes. 
</p><p>
<b>La-Jing II: La-Jing at Standing Up</b>
</p><p>
1.	Find a door threshold.  Raise both arms up on each side of door support, trying to extend both arms out as much as possible.
</p><p>
2.	One foot is at front bending; another foot is behind, straightening.
</p><p>
3.	Body is parallel to door, head straight, eyes looking ahead levelly.
</p><p>
4.	Stay at this stand for three minutes.  Then exchange legs: one hind leg brings to front bending and the front leg pushes back straightening.  Three minutes too.
</p><p>
This method can pull shoulder blades, all around shoulders, backs and their attached tendons and ligaments.  You can heal your own shoulder pain, frozen shoulders, joint pains & inflammation, back pains, etc. at your own home. 
</p><p>
<b>Arm pain </b>and <b>high blood pressure </b>can be cured by La-Jing.
</p><p>
An uncle of Master Zhu's friend had a problem with his left hand and left arm/shoulder.  It seriously affects his life and his daily routine.  After paying visits to several western/Chinese doctors without any improvements, he took many drugs without a diagnosis.  After Master Zhu・s examination, he determined that the patient had a Jin-Shuo (shrunken tendon).  He immediately instructed the patient to hold onto the door side practicing La-Jing standing style.  After extending his arms 3 minutes each side, the pain was significantly reduced.  Master Zhu practiced chiropractor exercises and acupuncture treatments on the patient. His pain was further reduced.  Zhu・s friend asked Master Zhu how many more treatments were needed because the old man was in Beijing during his retirement trip and was heading back home to Chung-Qing immediately.  Master Zhu said once is enough.  After returning home, the patient just needed to do La-Jing exercises on a daily basis.  Because he had high blood pressure, it・s best to practice both standing and lying down styles for his overall health to adjust his organs.  It's best to stop taking his blood pressure pills.
</p><p>
About two months later, the old man called from Chung-Qing.  The pain on his left hand and left arm was completely gone.  He said excitedly that he was afraid to stop taking his high blood pressure pills in the beginning.  Later when he practiced La-Jing daily, and changed from once a day to three times a day, he gradually weaned himself off the medicine.  Now his blood pressure was within the normal range.  His dizziness was gone too.

<p><b>
Cautions
</b></p><p>
We can practice La-Jing (pulling tendon) in the area of shoulder blades, surrounding shoulder, back, and its surrounding tendons, ligaments in the region.  This exercise can also heal frozen shoulder, shoulder pain, and shoulder inflammation.
</p><p>
1.	For people with high blood pressure, heart problems, osteoporosis, in a long-term weakened physical state, it is necessary to check with your doctor to see if La-Jing is suitable for you.  This is because that La-Jing exercise will cause pain first before getting better.  While sustaining pain, you may experience a higher rate of heart beat, and a higher blood pressure.  For people with osteoporosis, it is important not to encounter bone splits or break.  Physically weak people may faint from feeling pain.  It is suitable to take it easy for elderly and the sick.  It is good to put a pillow below head to prevent blood rush to head.  As long as you persist on a long term basis, the effect may surface soon enough.

<p>
2.	During La-Jing, if the person exhibits numb, cold, face turning blue, cold sweat, or over-breathing syndrome, the best method is to use either paper bag or plastic one to hold onto the person・s nose and mouth to form an enclosed breathing area.  After 5 minutes, symptoms should disappear and the person returns to normal.
</p><p>
To see whether you need La-Jing is to bend naturally and see where your arms/hands can reach toward ground.  If it is more than 15" then you definitely need to practice La-Jing.
</p><p>
You can practice La-Jing any place using practical surroundings: like park bench near a tree truck, or office wall.  You can change practicing locations by changing your position a bit like using just room floor without chairs while raising one leg straight on the wall but sliding the other foot on the side floor against an object for support.
</p><p>
This is an TCM whole body healing.  It is very different from western medicine's "treat head for headaches, treat feet for feet pains".  La-Jing method does not require any knowledge of pressure points. It can be used simply to sooth and to move meridians.  "If there is pain, there is blockage.  If there is free flow, there is no pain." La-Jing can effectively remove various pain.  It is also natural healing without side effects.
