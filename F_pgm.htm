The <b>objective </b>of our fertility program is to:
</p><p><ul><li>improve and increase the possibility of fertilization of women so they have a better chance in reproduction of their offsprings.
</li><li>relieve women's stress related to infertility and its treatments.
</li><li>improve the production and quality of ova.
</ii><li>normalize the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and menstrual cycle 3.
</li><li>reduce the risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy.
</li><li> provide an alternative treatment for patients who are intolerant, ineligible, contraindicated or simply cannot afford conventional infertility treatments.
</ul></p><p>
(<b>ART</b> stands for Assisted Reproductive Technology, <b>IUI </b>stands for intrauterine insemination, and <b>IVF</b> stands for invitro-fertilization.)

<br /><p><b>Treatment Protocols without ART/IUI/IVF procedures</b>:
</p><p>Some women prefer natural fertility and childbirth without any human intervention.  Chinese medicine can help improve women's fertility by gently inducing their reproduction capability with Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture treatments.  
</p><p>In order to follow these treatment, women need to have a basic understanding of how their body works naturally.  This means that their bodies follow a monthly cycle of 26 to 31 days with a follicular phase and a luteal phase.  These can be tracked by simply measuring their body temperature every morning before leaving their beds after a restful sleep. (Please check <a href="fertility.htm"><b><i> Basic Fertility 101 </i></b></a> for furthur details).  During the monthly menstrual cycle, there are four specific phases we ask our clients to track and follow:
</p><p><ul><li> <b>menstruation period </b>- when the body releases all the build-up in the uteriene wall that has not been used for conception, it is also the time to build up ovary functions and egg quality.
The first set of herbal intakes should start on the first day of the period and end at the period.
</li><li> <b>follical period </b> after menstruation - this signifies enhancement of ovary in preparation for ovulation.
The second set of herbal intakes should start on the last day of the period and end when the body temporature (BBT) rises. 
</li><li> <b>ovaulation </b> - this kicks off to strengthen the uterine lining.
The third set of herbal intakes should start when the BBT or morning body temperature rises and stop three days later (or following the herbalist's specific instructions). 
</li><li> <b>luteal phase </b>after ovulation - this is time to move the blood and to prepare for bleeding.
The final set of daily herbal intakes should start at the end of last phase until the start of next cycle which is indicated when the blood flow starts again. </li)</ul>
</p><p>Acupuncture and herbal treatments may vary by the changes of four phases.  These treatments support and enhance the natural functions of our physical body and therefore improve the probability of conception when it occurs. 
</p>

<br /><p><b>Acupuncture treatment protocols to complement ART</b>
</p><p>Our clients are urged to follow the <b>Treatment Protocols without ART/IUI/IVF procedures</b> as outlined in the above section.  In addition, our also include the following protocol when ART is involved: 
</p><p><ol><li>
In the <b>Pre-IVF phase</b>, weekly acupuncture is recommended for at least three months to alleviate the side effects of medical treatments, increase the response to hormonal stimulation and improve the reproductive organs and overall health.
</li><li>
In the 2nd phase, for the <b>duration of the IVF treatment</b>, weekly acupuncture plus pre & post transfer acupuncture is recommended. This will increase blood flow to the uterus and ovaries, reduce the stress response caused by IVF and calm the uterus to facilitate implantation.
</li><li>
In the <b>Post-IVF phase</b>, weekly acupuncture for up to three months is recommended for pregnant patients to reduce their risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. It is essential for patients with a history of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy to receive treatment during this phase.
</li></ol><p>
The above protocol can easily be modified to accommodate just about any ART procedure.
