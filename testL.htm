"I had seriously hurt my shoulder in the gym doing flies with weights and had just increased the pounds of the weights. One arm went back way to far and then I hurled it forward. I felt like I had done something to it but I didn't stop and so I continued to hurt it more. After a few months of hoping it was just get better on itself if I didn't do weights but it didn't. I couldn't sleep at night, it affected my employment as I need to be using sign  language with my job.  Finally I went to an orthopedic surgeon and he felt that I had an inflammed tendon and sent me for some aggressive physical therapy which became very painful. I then went for an MRI and it did not seem like I had a torn rotator cuff so the doctor gave me a cortisone shot and more physical therapy....this approach still did not help and now I am approaching 1 yr since hurting the shoulder.  The doc said that probably surgery would be the best approach but to wait a bit. I FINALLY contacted Eugenia and told her what was happening and she started to see me...after about three months I became pretty much pain free, I could sign for longer periods of time and the doctor refused to even consider surgery anymore. It's been 2 years now since I hurt my shoulder but I am able to use it more normally and I contribute it all to having accupuncture treatment with Eugenia. "<br />
