32 year old Katie came to the clinic for her <b>endometriosis </b>issues.  She was diagnosed with endometriosis ten years ago.

Upon palpation on Katie's abdomen, the strongest palpation pain was found on her mid section on the stomach channel. A secondary palpation pain was found along the central channel on the mid-line above her pubic bone.  Katie also felt palpation discomfort at her Dan-Tien area below her naval.
</p><p>
Acupuncture treatments centered along Katie's spleen and liver channels on her lower limbs. Seven to ten thread moxa were lighted near the point Li-Gou.  Since Katie loves the warm feeling of kyutoshin and her abdomen felt cold, warming kneedles were applied in her abdomenum area.  After twenty minutes, the needles were pulled out and her back treatments ensued.
</p><p>
Similar treatments were applied in the following twelve weeks.  After two months of continuous treatments, Katie reported that she was <b>pregnant </b>.

34 year old Michelle lost 20 pounds last year due to job stress.  Then she found a big lump in her abdomenal area.  She was then diagnosed with several <b>fibroids </b>in and outside of her womb.  The bigger one had about 10 centimeter in diameter.  The lumps did not cause any pain. She started acupuncture treatments as her doctor recommended it.  
</p><p>
Every time she had the acupuncture treatment, the size of the lump was visibly shrunk about 20%.  The texture of the lump was also turned more condensed after each treatment.  
</p><p>
However when she returned sever to ten days later for her next acpuncture treatment, the lump in her abdomen expended back to a lumpier and larger size.  As acupuncture treatment was done each time, the size of the lump was shrunk again. This pattern persisted.  The progression of shrinkage of Michelle's fibroid was in the right direction but it was slow.  She was told if she could have more frequent treatments such as twice weekly, it would make more significant progression.  But Michelle's work schedule did not allow her to make it. 
</p><p>
It was then recommended that Michelle take Chinese herbal formula to help control the fibroids.  She agreed.
</p><p>
We are currently closely following Michelle's case to monitor her progress.

50 year old Mary began to experience <b>hot flashes, insomnia, palpitation,</b> and <b>anxiety </b>when her normal menstruation cycle began to lengthen and her menstrual blood flow turned heavy at times.  Her friend recommended acupuncture so Mary showed up at our clinic. 
</p><p>   
After first treatment, Mary's hot flashes, palpitation, and anxiety reduced significantly.  She still had some issues about insomnia, although it was improved.  After six weekly treatments, Mary felt significant improvement in her issues.  Since she was feeling better, We recommended that she come in for every other weekly treatments.  After a couple of months, Mary felt much better.

34 year old Erin had been on birth control pills for ten years.  She and her husband recently had began to <b>plan for children</b>. Erin had always had scanty periods while on birth control.  She did not find it odd not to have periods months at a time.  But now Erin wanted to get pregnant.  Her doctor recommended that she try acupuncture to help her get her periods back before trying to <b>get pregnant</b>. </p> <p>   
After six treatments, Erin was able to have regular menstrual flows. She was advised to eat warm and cooked food, stay away from dairy products and ice cream or icy drinks, and reduce her sugar intake ("if you have to have sweets, try it in the mornings but not after 3pm").
</p><p> 
She also started to take Chinese Herbal Medicine which comes in a powdered form.  She was to take them 3+1/2 spoonfuls morning and night with warm liquids for a couple of months.  After four months, Erin got pregnant.  </p><p>
Erin continues to get monthly acupuncture treatments until her child was born nine months later.
