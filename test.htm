I have had a <b>bad lower back </b> for years.  I have gone the route of a chiropractor which I believe has helped.  I can say with certainty that Eugenia has helped me so much.  She put in such effort and energy to work on my back.  Her treatment and massage was like no other.  I highly recommend her.  She follows up and is excellent at what she does. <br />

"I am a 60 year old professional ...the real problem was a case of <b>sciatica </b>... I am extremely confident that Eugenia will be able to help me...Its not very often that you meet such a professional like Eugenia but I definitely recommend her services to anybody who is experiencing any degree of pain, discomfort or ailment listed in her website to take the time to meet with Eugenia." <br />--- Paul O. <a href="testP.htm"> Read more of his story about <b> Sciatica </b></a>

"Eugenia gave me acupuncture last year, and it helped tremendously.
I've had <b>chronic back pain </b>for a long time, and the needle treatment
she recommended and administered for me relieved my pain and lifted my
spirits.  In addition to skillfully applying my treatment, she was
great about answering my questions about acupuncture.  I just wish I
lived near her so that I could have her treat me all the time!" <br />--- Chris S.
</p><p>
"If you ever were inclined to try acupuncture but were unsure whom to go to, you have found the right person.  My experience with Eugenia goes back to when she was still in school and working in a training clinic.   Her caring attitude, eagerness and dedication to help not only impressed me then but continue to do so now.  Her skills go beyond just acupuncture into the area of Chinese herbs.  As a patient of hers for over a year, I would not hesitate to recommend Eugenia to anyone interested in these alternate therapies. "<br />--- Jerry P. a <b>Multiple Sclerosis </b> patient</p>
<p>
"I had seriously hurt my shoulder... an inflammed tendon... very painful... I FINALLY contacted Eugenia and told her what was happening and she started to see me...I became pretty much pain free... I contribute it all to having accupuncture treatment with Eugenia. "<br />--- Lorna D. <a href="testP.htm"> Read more of her story about <b>shoulder pain </b></a></p></div></div></div>
