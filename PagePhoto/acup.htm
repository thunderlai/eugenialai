</p><p>
Feeling healthy goes beyond the absence of acute or chronic illness.  Often, we don・t acknowledge our health until it is compromised.  And only then do we seek ways to regain it.
</p><p>
Acupuncture and Chinese medicine can help you along the path toward optimal health and vitality, physically, emotionally and spiritually.
</p><p>
These are the steps of care that can lead you toward a balanced, healthy and holistic lifestyle.

<p>
Most patients begin acupuncture treatment to receive quick relief from pain, discomfort and other symptoms.  This is Acute Care.  This type of care allows you to feel better faster.  Each visit build on previous visits, paving the way toward eliminating your problems and complaints.
</p><p>
Frequent visits over the next few weeks or months may be needed to further reduce your symptoms, depending on your condition, age, lifestyle and the quality and quantity of your energy, call Qi (pronounced ：chee；).  After acute care, you will notice that your aches or pains have been dramatically reduced or eliminated.
</p><p>
This next phase is Maintenance Care.  Signs and symptoms have been reduced, and visits are less frequent.  This phase maintains and supports the changes you have achieved and provides a foundation for deeper healing.  This is also the time when underlying problems can be addressed.
</p><p>
Even though you may not be experiencing symptoms, it is important to continue to strengthen, build and support your body.  Stopping care now could disrupt the progress you have already achieved.  Even simple activities could cause a relapse.
</p><p>
Wellness and Preventative Care are the next phase.  This type of care preserves all the progress you have made.  Visits may be monthly, every other month or seasonal.  Much the same way you keep a car running smoothly with regular oil changes and tune-ups, periodic visits to your acupuncturist can keep you running smoothly.  These preventative maintenance tune-ups further strengthen your body・s resistance, keeping you healthy, balanced and potentially free from illness.  Little problems may be caught before they become major concerns.
</p><p>
Wellness care is the root of healing.  In ancient times, an acupuncturist was only compensated as long as patients remained healthy.  If they became ill, it was the doctor・s duty to get them well again without compensation.
</p><p>
An acupuncture lifestyle combined with regular exercise, a healthy diet and other good habits can keep you looking, feeling and performing at your best.
</p><p>
Treatments may be combined with herbs, cupping, moxibustion, meditation, massage, Qi Gong or light exercise.  These techniques are added to further relieve symptoms, speed recovery time and pave the way toward health, vitality and longevity.
